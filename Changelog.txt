		Set_Value Supported for NumberSprite objects

		Screen based Coordinates (based off position 0, 0 in upper left)

		KNOWN BUGS/PROJECTS:
			BUG: Cannot set value for radio button, tab, or checkbox objects
				ISSUE: no set_mFrame() function, and draw updates inside if statements

				ISSUE: No pallet loaded for top screen
				SOLUTION: Make Pallets Screen Insensitive - Allow All Sprites To Be Displayed on Both Screens
						pallets on different screens can have the same number and the same name.
						now a pallet is loaded for both top and bottom screen for every different object :)
				
			BUG: Tabs on Top Screen Not Displaying
				ISSUE: Pallets are not loaded on top screen

								      available for use, only up/down / right/left

			BUG: TabGroups do not wrap properly if not 4 tabs in size
				ISSUE: wrapping code only supports 4 tab TabGroup sizes
				SOLUTIOn: rewrite wrapping code with 0 and Tabs.size()-1 as first and last members of
						a TabGroup, setting the newtab to first and last if the button presses 
						go beyond first and last

	VERSION 0.7.4

		TabGroups have custom key_presses, and rewrite of TabGroups wrapping to support TabGroups of all sizes

		KNOWN BUGS/PROJECTS:
			BUG: HydTab on top screen is glitching and displaying parts of a checkbox from teleTab on top screen
				ISSUE: a sprite is being deleted that does not exist (title sprite for CheckBox Disabled for TeleTab on topscreen)

				(corresponding objects are: HydTab and HydTabTop, HasHybrid and HasHybridTop, 
				 BridgeTab and TeleTab, Disabled and Balanc/BalanCO, None and EndTab)
				ISSUE: Corresponding Sprites have The Same Sprite Numbers, just on different screens.  
			       	       PA_SpriteTouched(u8) must not compensate for the fact that presses must be on bottom screen.
				SOLUTION: Whenever Checking for PA_SpriteTouched(u8), check that the sprite is on the bottom screen

			BUG: NumberSprites are being changed by keys even when they have no key set
				ISSUE: there is no default binding for NO KEY
				SOLUTION: dev<input.h> enum of keys was changed, KEY_NONE added, to correspond to no key, 
						default key for numbersprites is KEY_NONE

				ISSUE: code for adding digit uses a sprite number every time the current number of digits is less 
						than the greatest number of digits at one time
				SOLUTION: changed a != to a > in the if statement for adding a sprite number to a NumberSprite object in 
							NumberSprite::add_digit()
							
			BUG: NumberSprite objects seem to lag when using set_value with large numbers
				ISSUE: only one digit was added each time through the function NumberSprite::draw()
				SOLUTION: changed if statements to while loops, all digits are added in one run of draw() when using set_value
